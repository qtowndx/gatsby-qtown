Excerpt: "The primary goal of this site... "

The primary goal of this site is to provide a collaborative means of preserving the history of Queenstown Village. In its first
iteration, the content of the site is generated from a limited number of sources,  hence it lacks the diversity  of the community. I am hopeful that members
of the community will  provide content to produce a more dynamic and expansive site.
